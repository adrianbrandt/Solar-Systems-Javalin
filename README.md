##### This WebPage is Fully customizable for whatever usage you want!

![System Example](Systems.png)
### Solar System Application:
This Solar System Application is mainly built using Java. It Uses Custom Controllers and basic Celestial Body Models. <br />
It has possibility to use JSON and CSV Format. I Just prefer CSV (Hence why i put more work in to that specific repo.) <br />
Mainly For School type of Work as i dont see much usage of this exact page for anything else. Can be customized so you do you. <br />
Vue Components Can be Found under Resources/vue/views. This can be used to edit the pages and their functionality. <br />
Not much work put in to the website part as i mainly focus on functionality.
